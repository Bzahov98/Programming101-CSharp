# Asp.Net MVC Problems

## Develop a solution which provides CRUD operation over a table in the database (Hint:use EF and default ASP.NET MVC generated controller based on EF if it is too complicated for you)
* Create Controller for the table
* Implement Edit,Index,Details,Delete,Create views
* If you use automatically generated template then implement Repository which should handle all EF operations instead of putting them directly in the code
