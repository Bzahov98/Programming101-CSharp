This week we will get familiar with the most basic UI frameworks
for .NET, namely Windows Forms and WPF

## Windows Forms

Windows Forms is the oldest (some already call it ancient) UI framework
on .NET. It represents a wrapper around the Win32 API (the API for writing
UI before .NET even existed). The Windows Forms framework is centered
around controls (components) which communicate with each other via events and event handlers
and expose their internal state with properties. For example, the CheckBox
control has a boolean property CheckedChanged which fires when the user checks
or unchecks the checkbox and a CheckedState property which tells us the current
state of the check box (checked/unchecked/indeterminate).

A good step-by-step tutorial can be found on MSDN: [Getting Started with Visual C# and Visual Basic](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd492132.aspx)

### Creating a Windows Forms project

Simply click `File -> New -> Project` and select `Windows Forms Application`
from the menu.

### Form

What you will see now is an empty standard-looking window inside Visual Studio.
This is the designer surface where you can arrange and design your forms. The
Form class is the base class for a window. When you create the project you will
have an autogenerated Form1 class which inherits the Form class.

### Properties

Right click the form in the designer and click properties. This will open the
properties window where you can edit the properties of the selected component.
Here you can change the Text, the Size and the BackColor of the form. Each property
you set in the Properties window actually generates C# code which goes into the
Form1.Designer.cs file.

### Project structure

A new Windows Forms project initially has 3 files: `Form1.cs` Form1.Designer.cs` and `Program.cs`.

`Program.cs` as usual contains the Main method. It will contain autogenerated code which displays
the window defined by Form1.

`Form1.Designer.cs` contains the code generated
